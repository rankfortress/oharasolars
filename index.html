	Each and every person that walks through our doors, that we speak to on the phone or over Zoom deserve the utmost respect because very simply our clients are the most important part of our organization. You will be treated the way you expect to be treated as a patron of a company and you’ll enjoy speaking with our friendly, caring and respectful Energy Experts. We encourage you to ask us as many questions as possible and to always be comfortable during each step of the solar process. If you would like to speak to other solar clients of ours in your city then we can arrange that for you with our Referral Team, so that you know we do exactly what we say we will and that we practice what we preach. Our Projects Managers will be in communication with you throughout the entire process; from your solar proposal presentation all the way through to receiving Permission To Operate from your utility provider (this is the exciting part – when we flick the switch to turn your system on) so we encourage you to let them know if there’s anything you think we could do better. We always want to get better and always want to lead the way in providing the best solar experience for Orange County homeowners, businesses and nonprofits!.
